🐍 Python Daily Practice Repository
Welcome! This repository contains my daily Python learning practice. I'm currently learning Python basics as part of my goal to become a job-ready Python developer in 6 months. This includes code examples, solved problems, and key concepts I study each day.

📅 Daily Progress:

Day	    |  Topics Covered	            |   Folder
1	    |  print(), input(), variables	|    Day 1
2	    |  Data types, basic math, I/O	|    Day 2
